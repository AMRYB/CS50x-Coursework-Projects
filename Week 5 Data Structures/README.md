# 🌳 Week 5 – Data Structures

In Week 5 of CS50x, the focus shifts to data structures including linked lists, trees, and hash tables. These projects involve simulating inheritance, building a spell checker, and working with dictionaries in C.

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1. 👪 Inheritance
- **File**: `inheritance.c`
- **Description**: Simulates the inheritance of blood types and alleles across multiple generations using recursion and structs.
- **Concepts**: structs, recursion, randomization.

#### 💡 How to Run:
```bash
gcc -o inheritance inheritance.c -lm
./inheritance
```

---

### 2. 🧠 Speller
- **Files**: `speller.c`, `dictionary.c`
- **Description**: A spell checker that loads a dictionary into a hash table and checks text files for misspelled words.
- **Concepts**: hash tables, file I/O, pointers, dynamic memory.

#### 💡 How to Run:
```bash
make speller
./speller text.txt
```
