## üöÄ Getting Started

To run most projects:

1. Navigate to the specific week's folder.
2. Compile C files with:
   ```bash
   gcc -o program program.c -lm
   ./program
   ```
3. Run Python files with:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
4. For Flask apps, run:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
